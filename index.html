				Here are just three interesting facts about me:
				<div class="facts">
					<li>
						I have a very international background. I have studied and worked in 3 different continents, have travelled
						to 19 countries so far, and can speak and write fluent English and Korean.
					</li>
					<li>
						My favourite fruit is an avocado (fun fact: <a
							href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/avocado-health-facts-didnt-dont-know_n_3786419">avocado are actually
							fruits</a>) and my favourite drink is Americano with oat milk.
					</li>
					<li>
						I have experience working in front end, back end, and full stack software development. I have previously
						interned for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">Amazon (AWS)</a> and <a
